The current error handling is done in the client, and that is
somewhat suitable.  The Tile class probably has room to validate
based on information provided in the collection of tiles.

bin/scrabble is using StandardError when raising an error, but we
may do better.  At least it should be an InputError as that is
more informative and precise.
