We have decided against that, as shown in commit
4c3ebf6eda71977348af9e6b921b557b1aaa14a9

We discussed it in patches, and accepted it in regards to:

https://lists.sr.ht/~kotp/coding_with_andrew/patches/10909

Please forgive the noisy patchset, patches 1/4..4/4 were applied, the
rest were addressed in other patchsets.
